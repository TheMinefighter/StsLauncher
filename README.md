# StsLauncher
StsLauncher is an openjdk compatible jnlp (javaws) launcher build specifically to fulfill the needs of stellwerksim.de

# Problems
Currently it only works with java 8, but that should change in the future.
If you start STS you currently get an error message from STS, but the program starts anyway. You can safely ignore that error. I am planning to fix that anyway.

# Other Plans
If I have too much time in the future I might build a CI pipeline for this
